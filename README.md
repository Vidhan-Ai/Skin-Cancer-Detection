# Skin Cancer Detection App - README

## Overview
This repository contains a **Skin Cancer Detection Application** designed to assist in early diagnosis of skin cancer. The app uses machine learning to analyze skin lesion images and determine the likelihood of malignancy. It is developed as a tool for educational purposes and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.

## Features
- Upload images of skin lesions for analysis.
- Machine learning model trained on publicly available datasets for skin cancer detection.
- Detailed prediction results with confidence scores.
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
- Portable and responsive design for mobile and desktop platforms.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Other Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-cancer-detection-app.git
   cd skin-cancer-detection-app
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate    # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   The app will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Dataset
The app uses a pre-trained model based on the **HAM10000 dataset**, a comprehensive collection of dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions. You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000) if you wish to retrain the model.

## Usage
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Upload an image of the skin lesion.
3. Wait for the analysis to complete.
4. View the prediction results, including confidence scores.

## Screenshots
(Add screenshots of the app here to give users a visual understanding of the interface.)

## Limitations
- The model's predictions are based on the dataset it was trained on and may not generalize to all cases.
- It is not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis.
- Performance is dependent on image quality and proper lighting conditions.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with cloud-based services for scalable deployment.
- Improved model accuracy with additional data and training.
- User account management for tracking predictions.
- Multi-language support.
